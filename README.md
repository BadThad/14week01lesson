# My Mongoose Groceries

A simple project to test this server which is made with Express and Mongoose.

Once set up I added some groceries to the "shopping list" via the POST route in Insomnia.

| **Routes**          | **Description**          |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| GET                 | Fetch all items      |
| POST                | Add new items        |
| PUT                 | Edit an item by ID   |
| DELETE              | Delete an item by ID |
